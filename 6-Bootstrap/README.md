#Bootstrap Project 

Doing a replica of a bootstrap website from the Rob Percival course. Doing this on my own first and will do tutorial afterwards. 

Scrollspy isn't working in bootstrap v4 alpha 6 will try and do it with javascript. 

For now have pretty much all the functionality of his besides the scrollspy.
