# Complete-Web-Developer-2.0-Projects
These are projects done through the Udemy Course of The Complete Web Developer 2.0 by Rob Percival. 

I will just be adding links to the websites and also to my github repos. 

Project 1: Create a basic HTML site without any CSS. Didn't do a github repo as I think the code is too basic.
